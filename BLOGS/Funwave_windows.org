#+TITLE: Compile FUNWAVE on Windows 10 ( via Linux Subsystem ) 
#+OPTIONS: tex:t
#+CATEGORY: Computational Hydrodynamics 

* Preface

The FUNWAVE code is developed with UNIX based operation systems (Linux and OSX).
It used to be easy to compile With Microsoft Windows, but after the MPI feature was
introduced in FUNWAVE, people found diffculties when compiling with Windows OS.
Now, owing to a new feature of Windows 10, called *Windows Subsystem for Linux*,
the FUNWAVE code can be compiled with Windows 10 without annoying
compling rules for windows. The Linux subsystem allows the users to run Linux command in Windows OS. In some sense, the Linux subsystem is similar to the 
virtual machine approach, but it is much easier and much more power than the
virtual machine in the following aspects:

- fantastic connection between Windows and Linux. You can log in to the Linux
  subsystem by simply type bash in windows command window, Besides, one can
  get access and write files to *any* files using the bash commends, 
- No limitation of CPU and RAM.Unlike the virtual machine, Linux system can use
  all CPU and RAM of the PC without any restriction.

* Install Linux Subsystem for Windows 10

Make sure you have installed Windows 10 and logged in with your Microsoft
account.

The first step is to enable the *Developer mode* in windows settings

Then turn on *Windows Subsystem for Linux* in /Control Panel/

Now Download a Linux distribution in /Microsoft Store/. Personally I prefer Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

After install, you should be able to launch the linux subsystem.

* Get ready with Linux Subsytem

The first time one launch the Linux subsystem, it takes a couple minutes to
initialization. After the initialization, one would be requested to set the
username and password.

type the following commands then you are all set


#+BEGIN_SRC bash
sudo apt upfate
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install make
sudo apt install gfortran
sudo apt install mpich
#+END_SRC

If you are in China, I would remommend you to change the apt source to the
Chinese host. 

* Compile and run FUNWAVE
